    <p>
        SignAI is an innovative AI-based application that bridges the communication gap
        between the hearing and the deaf communities. By using advanced machine learning models,
        SignAI can recognize sign language in real time – transforming gestures into spoken words and vice versa.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Our mission is to make communication accessible to everyone.
        SignAI is trained on tens of thousands of video samples from diverse, large-scale datasets.
        Through continuous development, the system is able to detect subtle differences in hand movements,
        facial expressions, and context to provide accurate translations.

        The desktop version of SignAI provides a powerful environment for testing, recording,
        and analyzing sign language. It allows users to record custom videos
        and instantly receive accurate translations.
